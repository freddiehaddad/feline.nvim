# Usage

This is a full guide to customizing Feline to build your own statusline
configuration from scratch. While this may look daunting at first, be assured
that this is very easy once you understand it. But before you can customize
Feline, you have to understand how Feline works.

## Components

Feline has a statusline generator that takes a `components` value, which is a
Lua table that needs to contain the statusline components. Inside the
`components` table, there needs to be two tables, `active` and `inactive`, which
will dictate whether the component is a part of the statusline when it's in an
active window or an inactive window. Inside each of the `active` and `inactive`
tables, you can put any amount of tables, each of which will indicate a section
of the statusline.

For example, if you want two sections (left and right), you can put two tables
inside each of the `active` and `inactive` tables. If you want three sections
(left, mid and right), you can put three tables inside each of the `active` and
`inactive` tables. There is no limit to the amount of sections you can have.
It's also possible to have a different amount of sections for the `active` and
`inactive` statuslines.

So first, in your init.lua file, you have to initialize the components table
like this:

```lua
-- Initialize the components table
local components = {
    active = {},
    inactive = {}
}
```

You can then add new sections to the statusline by adding an element to the
`active` or `inactive` tables. For example:

```lua
-- Insert three sections (left, mid and right) for the active statusline
table.insert(components.active, {})
table.insert(components.active, {})
table.insert(components.active, {})

-- Insert two sections (left and right) for the inactive statusline
table.insert(components.inactive, {})
table.insert(components.inactive, {})
```

Now you can add statusline components to each of those sections by adding
elements to the sections. For example:

```lua
-- Insert a component that will be on the left side of the statusline
-- when the window is active:
table.insert(components.active[1], {
    -- Component info here
})

-- Insert another component that will be on the left side of the statusline
-- when the window is active:
table.insert(components.active[1], {
    -- Component info here
})

-- Insert a component that will be in the middle of the statusline
-- when the window is active:
table.insert(components.active[2], {
    -- Component info here
})

-- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
-- when the window is active:
table.insert(components.active[3], {
    -- Component info here
})

-- Insert a component that will be on the left side of the statusline
-- when the window is inactive:
table.insert(components.inactive[1], {
    -- Component info here
})

-- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
-- when the window is inactive:
table.insert(components.inactive[2], {
    -- Component info here
})
```

Alternatively you can also use Lua table indices instead of table.insert, like:

```lua
-- Insert a component that will be on the right side of the statusline
-- when the window is active:
components.active[3][1] = {
    -- Component info here
}

-- Insert another component that will be on the right side of the statusline
-- when the window is active:
components.active[3][2] = {
    -- Component info here
}
```

**NOTE:** If you use the index instead of table.insert, remember to put the
correct index. Also keep in mind that unlike most other programming languages,
Lua indices start at `1` instead of `0`.

### Component values

You can use component values to customize each component to your liking.
Providing the values isn't necessary and you can omit all of the component
values, in which case the defaults would be used instead. The component values
can either be set to a fixed value or a function that generates the value every
time the statusline is being generated.

Though you should keep in mind that if a component value is set to a function,
the function can take no arguments. The [`provider`](#component-providers) value
is an exception to this rule (more on that below). The return type of the
function must also be the same as the type of value required by the component.
For example, since [`enabled`](#conditionally-enable-components) requires a
boolean value, if you set it to a function, the function must also return a
boolean value.

The different kinds of component values are discussed below.

#### Component providers

The `provider` value of a component can be a table, string or function.

If it's a string, it represents the text to show.

```lua
-- Providers can simply just contain a string, such as:
provider = 'some text here'
```

A string value can also refer to a [default provider](#default-providers). When
the name of a default provider is used as the value of `provider`, it uses the
default provider for the component.

```lua
provider = 'position' -- This will use the default file position provider
```

Some of these providers can also take some special options, in which case the
value of `provider` can be a table containing two values: `name` which
represents the name of the provider, and `opts` which represents the options
passed to the provider.

```lua
provider = {
    name = 'file_info',
    opts = {
        type = 'unique',
        file_modified_icon = 'M'
    }
}
```

Note that you can also use your [manually added providers](#setup-function) the
same way as the default providers.

The value of `provider` can also be set to a function. The function must return
a string when called. The function may also optionally return an
[`icon`](#component-icon) value alongside the string, which would represent the
provider's default icon. The provider functions can take two arguments:
`component`, which represents the component itself and can be used to access the
component values from within the provider, and `opts`, which represents the
provider options discussed above.

Here are a few examples of setting the provider to a function:

```lua
-- Here's an example of a basic provider with no arguments
provider = function()
    return tostring(#vim.api.nvim_list_wins())
end

-- Providers can take the component itself as an argument to access the component values using the
-- first argument passed to the provider function
provider = function(component)
    if component.icon then
        return component.icon
    else
        return ''
    end
end
```

Functions that are added as [custom providers](#setup-function) can also take a
second argument, `opts`, which represents the provider options given to the
provider (if any). For example:

```lua
provider = function(_, opts)
    if opts.return_two then
        return 2
    else
        return 3
    end
end
```

If you omit the provider value, it will be set to an empty string. A component
with no provider or an empty provider may be useful for things like
[applying a highlight to section gaps](#highlight-section-gaps) or just having
an icon or separator as a component.

##### Update provider value using triggers

Sometimes the provider value has to do some heavy operations, which makes it
undesirable to run the provider function every time the statusline is generated.
Feline allows you to conditionally re-run the provider function by triggering an
update to the provider string through either an autocmd or a function. Until the
provider function is run again, the value from the previous execution of the
provider function is used as the provider string.

Updating provider value through triggers is achieved through the `update` key in
the `provider` table. `update` can be either a boolean value, a table or a
function that returns a boolean value or a table. If it's a boolean value, then
the provider will be updated if value is `true`. For example:

```lua
provider = {
    name = 'my_provider',
    -- Only update provider if there are less than 4 windows in the current tabpage
    update = function()
        return #vim.api.nvim_tabpage_list_wins(0) < 4
    end
}
```

If it's a table, it must contain a list of autocmds that will trigger an update
for the provider. For example:

```lua
provider = {
    name = 'my_provider',
    -- Only update provider if a window is closed or if a buffer is deleted
    update = { 'WinClosed', 'BufDelete' }
}
```

#### Component name

A component can optionally be given a name. While the component is not required
to have a name and the name is mostly useless, it can be used to check if the
component has been [truncated](#truncation). To give a component a name, just
set its `name` value to a `string`, shown below:

```lua
local my_component = {
    name = 'a_unique_name'
}
```

Two components inside the `active` or `inactive` table cannot share the same
name, so make sure to give all components unique names.

#### Truncation

Feline has an automatic smart truncation system where components can be
automatically truncated if the statusline doesn't fit within the available
space. It can be useful if you want to make better use of screen space. It also
allows you to better manage which providers are truncated, how they are
truncated and in which order they are truncated.

**NOTE:** Truncation only works on Neovim 0.6 and above. If you're using an
earlier release, truncation will not work and all configurations related to it
will be silently ignored.

There are a few component values associated with truncation which are described
below.

##### Component short provider

`short_provider` is an optional component value that allows you to take
advantage of Feline's truncation system. Note that this should only be defined
if you want to enable truncation for the component, otherwise it's absolutely
fine to omit it.

`short_provider` works just like the `provider` value, but is activated only
when the component is being truncated due to the statusline not fitting within
the window. `short_provider` is independent from the `provider` value so it can
be a different provider altogether, or it can be a shortened version of the same
provider or the same provider but with a different `opts` value. For example:

```lua
-- In this component, short provider uses same provider but with different opts
local file_info_component = {
    provider = {
        name = 'file_info',
        opts = {
            type = 'full-path'
        }
    },
    short_provider = {
        name = 'file_info',
        opts = {
            type = 'short-path'
        }
    }
}

-- Short provider can also be an independent value / function
local my_component = {
    provider = 'loooooooooooooooong',
    short_provider = 'short'
}
```

Feline doesn't set `short_provider` to any component by default, so it must be
provided manually.

##### Hide components during truncation

If you wish to allow Feline to hide a component entirely if necessary during
truncation, you may set the `truncate_hide` component value to `true`. By
default, `truncate_hide` is `false` for every component.

##### Component priority

When components are being truncated by Feline, you can choose to give some
components a higher priority over the other components. The `priority` component
value just takes a number. By default, the priority of a component is `0`.
Components are truncated in ascending order of priority. So components with
lower priority are truncated first, while components with higher priority are
truncated later on. For example:

```lua
-- This component has the default priority
local my_component = {
    provider = 'loooooooooooooooong',
    short_provider = 'short'
}
-- This component has a higher priority, so it will be truncated after the previous component
local high_priority_component = {
    provider = 'long provider with high priority',
    short_provider = 'short',
    priority = 1
}
```

Priority can also be set to a negative number, which can be used to make a
component be truncated earlier than the ones with default priority.

##### Check if component is truncated or hidden

If you give a component a `name`, you can check if that component has been
truncated or hidden by Feline's smart truncation system through the utility
functions, `require('feline').is_component_truncated` and
`require('feline').is_component_hidden`. Both of these functions take two
arguments, `winid` which is the window id of the window for which the
component's truncation is being checked, the second is the `name` of the
component. `is_component_truncated` returns `true` if a component has been
truncated or hidden, and `is_component_hidden` returns `true` only if a
component has been hidden. For [winbar](#winbar) components, use
`require('feline').winbar.is_component_truncated` and
`require('feline').winbar.is_component_hidden` instead.

#### Conditionally enable components

The `enabled` value of a component can be a boolean or function. This value
determines if the component is enabled or not. If false, the component is not
shown in the statusline. For example:

```lua
-- Enable if opened file has a valid size
enabled = function()
    return vim.fn.getfsize(vim.fn.expand('%:p')) > 0
end

-- Enable if current window width is higher than 80
enabled = function()
    return vim.api.nvim_win_get_width(0) > 80
end
```

#### Component icon

Some inbuilt providers such as `git_branch` provide default icons. If you either
don't have a patched font or don't like the default icon that Feline provides,
or if you want an icon for a component that doesn't have any default icons, you
may set this value to use any icon you want instead.

The component's icon can be a table, string or function. By default, the icon
inherits the component's highlight, but you can also change the highlight
specifically for the icon. To do this, you need to pass a table containing `str`
and `hl`, where `str` would represent the icon and `hl` would represent the icon
highlight. The icon's highlight works just like the `hl` component's values.

There's also another value you can set if the value of `icon` is a table, which
is `always_visible`. By default, the icon is not shown if the value returned by
the provider is empty. If you want the icon to be shown even when the provider
string is empty, you need to set `always_visible` to `true`.

```lua
-- Setting icon to a string
icon = ' + '

-- Setting icon to a function
icon = function() return ' - ' end

-- Setting icon to a table
icon = {
    str = ' ~ ',
    hl = { fg = 'orange' }
}

-- Making icon always visible
icon = {
    str = '',
    hl = {
        fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
        bg = 'black',
        style = 'bold'
    },
    always_visible = true
}
```

#### Component highlight

The `hl` component value represents the component highlight. It can be a table,
string or function.

If a string, it'll use the given string as the name of the component highlight
group. In that case, this highlight group must be defined elsewhere (i.e. in
your colorscheme or your Neovim configuration).

If it's a table, it'll automatically generate a highlight group for you based on
the given values. The hl table can have four values: `fg`, `bg`, `style` and
`name`.

The `fg` and `bg` values are strings that represent the RGB hex or
[name](#themes) of the foreground and background color of the highlight,
respectively. (eg: `'#FFFFFF'`, `'white'`). If `fg` or `bg` is not provided, it
uses the default foreground or background color provided in the `setup()`
function, respectively.

The `style` value is a string that determines the formatting style of the
component's text (do `:help attr-list` in Neovim for more info). By default it
is set to `'NONE'`

The `name` value is a string that determines the name of highlight group created
by Feline (eg: `'StatusComponentVimInsert'`). If a name is not provided, Feline
automatically generates a unique name for the highlight group based on the other
values, so you can also just omit the `name` and Feline will create new
highlights for you when required. However, setting `name` may provide a
performance improvement since Feline caches highlight names and doesn't take the
time to generate a name if the name is already provided by the user.

Note that if `hl` is a function that can return different values, the highlight
is not redefined if the name stays the same. Feline only creates highlights when
they don't exist, it never redefines existing highlights. So if `hl` is a
function that can return different values for `fg`, `bg` or `style`, make sure
to return a different value for `name` as well if you want the highlight to
actually change.

Here are a few examples using the `hl` value:

```lua
-- As a table
hl = {
    fg = 'skyblue'
}

-- As a string
hl = "MyStatuslineHLGroup"

-- As a function returning a table
hl = function()
    return {
        name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
        fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
        style = 'bold'
    }
end

-- As a function returning a string
hl = function()
    if require("feline.providers.vi_mode").get_vim_mode() == "NORMAL" then
        return "MyStatuslineNormal"
    else
        return "MyStatuslineOther"
    end
end
```

#### Component separators

There are two types of separator values that you can put in a component, which
are `left_sep` and `right_sep`, which represent the separator on the left and
the right side of the component, respectively.

The value of `left_sep` and `right_sep` can just be set to a string that's
displayed. You can use a function that returns a string just like the other
component values. The value can also be equal to the name of one of the
[separator presets](#separator-presets).

The value of `left_sep` and `right_sep` can also be a table or a function
returning a table. Inside the table there can be three values, `str`, `hl` and
`always_visible`. `str` represents the separator string and `hl` represents the
separator highlight. The separator's highlight works just like the component's
`hl` value. The only difference is that the separator's `hl` by default uses the
parent's background color as its foreground color.

By default, Feline doesn't show a separator if the value returned by the
provider is empty. If you want the separator to be shown even when the component
string is empty, you can set the `always_visible` value in the separator table
to `true`. If unset or set to `false`, the separator is not shown if the
component string is empty.

You can also set `left_sep` and `right_sep` to be a `table` containing multiple
separator elements. It's useful if you want to have different highlights for
different parts of the left/right separator of the same component, or if you
want to always show certain parts of the separator regardless of whether the
component string is empty, or if you just want to better organize the
component's separator.

For example:

```lua
-- Setting sep to a string
left_sep = ' '

-- Setting sep to a separator preset
left_sep = 'slant_right'

-- Setting sep to a table with highlight
left_sep = {
    str = 'slant_left',
    hl = {
        fg = 'oceanblue',
        bg = 'bg'
    }
}

-- Making sep always visible
right_sep = {
    str = ' ',
    always_visible = true
}

-- Setting sep to a function
right_sep = function()
    local values = { 'right_rounded', 'right_filled', 'right' }
    return values[math.random(#values)]
end

-- Setting sep to a list separator elements
right_sep = {
    {
        str = ' ',
        hl = {
            fg = 'NONE',
            bg = 'oceanblue'
        },
        always_visible = true
    },
    -- The line below is equivalent to { str = 'slant_right' }
    'slant_right'
}
```

### Component Examples

Now that we know of the possible values you can set in a component, let's make
some actual components to show you how it all looks like together:

<details>
<summary>Component example</summary>

```lua
-- Component that shows Vi mode with highlight
components.active[1][1] = {
    provider = 'vi_mode',
    hl = function()
        return {
            name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
            fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
            style = 'bold'
        }
    end,
    right_sep = ' '
}

-- Component that shows file info
components.active[1][2] = {
    provider = 'file_info',
    hl = {
        fg = 'white',
        bg = 'oceanblue',
        style = 'bold'
    },
    left_sep = {' ', 'slant_left_2'},
    right_sep = {'slant_right_2', ' '},
    -- Uncomment the next line to disable file icons
    -- icon = ''
}

-- Component that shows current file size
components.active[1][3] = {
    provider = 'file_size',
    right_sep = {
        ' ',
        {
            str = 'slant_left_2_thin',
            hl = {
                fg = 'fg',
                bg = 'bg'
            }
        },
        ' '
    }
}

-- Component that shows file encoding
components.active[2][1] = {
    provider = 'file_encoding'
}

-- Component that shows current git branch
components.active[3][1] = {
    provider = 'git_branch',
    hl = {
        fg = 'white',
        bg = 'black',
        style = 'bold'
    },
    right_sep = {
        str = ' ',
        hl = {
            fg = 'NONE',
            bg = 'black'
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

[**NOTE:** Remember to initialize the components table before assigning anything
to it]

## Setup function

Now that you know about the components table and how Feline components work, you
can learn about Feline's `setup()` function. The `setup()` function initializes
Feline with your provided configuration. The configuration can be passed to the
function through a table. The available configuration options are listed below:

- `components` - The [components table](#components).
- `conditional_components` - An array-like table containing conditionally
  enabled components tables, each element of the table must be a components
  table with an additional key, `condition`, which would be a function without
  arguments that returns a boolean value. If the function returns `true` for a
  certain window, then that components table will be used for the statusline of
  that window instead of the default components table. If multiple conditional
  components match a certain window, the first one in the table will be used. An
  example usage of this option is shown below:

```lua
conditional_components = {
    {
        -- Only use this components table for the 2nd window
        condition = function()
            return vim.api.nvim_win_get_number(0) == 2
        end,
        active = {
            -- Components used for active window
        },
        inactive = {
            -- Components used for inactive windows
        },
    },
    {
        -- Only use this components table for buffers of filetype 'lua'
        condition = function()
            return vim.api.nvim_buf_get_option(0, 'filetype') == 'lua'
        end,
        active = {
            -- Components used for active window
        },
        inactive = {
            -- Components used for inactive windows
        },
    }
}
```

- `custom_providers` - A table containing user-defined
  [provider functions](#component-providers). For example:

```lua
custom_providers = {
    window_number = function()
        return tostring(vim.api.nvim_win_get_number(0))
    end
}
```

- `theme` - Either a string containing the color theme name or a table
  containing the colors. The theme's `fg` and `bg` values also represent the
  default foreground and background colors, respectively. To know more about
  Feline themes, take a look at the [Themes](#themes) section
- `separators` - A table containing custom
  [separator presets](#separator-presets).
- `force_inactive` - A table that determines which buffers should always have
  the inactive statusline, even when they are active. It can have 3 values
  inside of it, `filetypes`, `buftypes` and `bufnames`, all three of them are
  tables which contain Lua patterns to match against file type, buffer type and
  buffer name respectively.<br><br> Default:

```lua
{
    filetypes = {
        '^NvimTree$',
        '^packer$',
        '^startify$',
        '^fugitive$',
        '^fugitiveblame$',
        '^qf$',
        '^help$'
    },
    buftypes = {
        '^terminal$'
    },
    bufnames = {}
}
```

- `disable` - Similar to `force_inactive`, except the statusline is disabled
  completely. Configured the same way as `force_inactive`. Feline doesn't
  disable the statusline on anything by default.
- `vi_mode_colors` - A table containing colors associated with Vi modes. It can
  later be used to get the color associated with the current Vim mode using
  `require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color()`. For more info on it
  see the [Vi-mode](#vi-mode) section.<br><br> Here is a list of all possible
  vi_mode names used with the default color associated with them:

| Mode        | Description           | Value       |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| `NORMAL`    | Normal mode           | `'green'`   |
| `OP`        | Operator pending mode | `'green'`   |
| `INSERT`    | Insert mode           | `'red'`     |
| `VISUAL`    | Visual mode           | `'skyblue'` |
| `LINES`     | Visual lines mode     | `'skyblue'` |
| `BLOCK`     | Visual block mode     | `'skyblue'` |
| `REPLACE`   | Replace mode          | `'violet'`  |
| `V-REPLACE` | Virtual Replace mode  | `'violet'`  |
| `ENTER`     | Enter mode            | `'cyan'`    |
| `MORE`      | More mode             | `'cyan'`    |
| `SELECT`    | Select mode           | `'orange'`  |
| `COMMAND`   | Command mode          | `'green'`   |
| `SHELL`     | Shell mode            | `'green'`   |
| `TERM`      | Terminal mode         | `'green'`   |
| `NONE`      | None                  | `'yellow'`  |

- `highlight_reset_triggers` - Feline automatically resets its cached highlights
  on certain autocommands to prevent the statusline colors from getting messed
  up. The value of `highlight_reset_triggers` can be set to a table containing a
  list of autocommands that'll trigger a highlight reset.<br><br> Default:
  `{'SessionLoadPost', 'ColorScheme'}`

## Winbar

Feline has support for winbar, a Neovim 0.8 feature that allows you to have a
bar at the top of each window. You can setup the winbar components using the
`require('feline').winbar.setup()` function. It works pretty much the same way
as the [setup function](#setup-function) for the statusline. However, it only
accepts the `components`, `conditional_components`, `force_inactive` and
`disable` values, the other values are shared between the statusline and the
winbar. Additionally, the default value of `force_inactive` for the winbar is
`{}`, which means the winbar is never forced to use the inactive components
table by default.

## Statuscolumn

Feline has support for statuscolumn, an experimental Neovim 0.9 feature that
allows you to customize the statuscolumn in similar fashion to the statusline
and winbar. Statuscolumn can be enabled and components configured using the
`require('feline').statuscolumn.setup()` function. It works pretty much the same
way as the [setup function](#setup-function) for the statusline. However, it
only accepts the `components`, `conditional_components`, `force_inactive` and
`disable` values, the other values are shared across all components.
Additionally, the default value of `force_inactive` for the statuscolumn is
`{}`, which means the statuscolumn is never forced to use the inactive
components table by default.

## Utility functions

Feline provides a few utility functions that allow you to customize or modify
Feline on the fly. These are discussed below.

### Reset highlight

If, for some reason, you want to clear all highlights that Feline sets (useful
if you want to reload your entire Neovim config which may mess up highlights),
you can do:

```lua
require('feline').reset_highlights()
```

Feline will automatically regenerate those highlights when it needs them, so you
don't have to worry about setting the highlights yourself.

## Default providers

Feline by default has some built-in providers to make your life easy. They are:

| Name                                  | Description                                    |

| `file_size`                           | Get file size                                  |
| `file_type`                           | Get file type                                  |
| `file_encoding`                       | Get file encoding                              |
| `file_format`                         | Get file format                                |
| [`git_branch`](#git)                  | Shows current git branch                       |
| [`git_diff_added`](#git)              | Git diff added count                           |
| [`git_diff_removed`](#git)            | Git diff removed count                         |
| [`git_diff_changed`](#git)            | Git diff changed count                         |

| [`diagnostic_info`](#diagnostics)     | Diagnostics info count                         |

Statuscolumn providers:

| Name          | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `fold_column` | Fold column for currently drawn line           |
| `line_number` | (relative) line number of currently drawn line |
| `sign_column` | Sign column for currently drawn line           |

The statuscolumn providers are minimal in their defaults and are meant to offer
guidance on how one might begin t configure these components. See the
`statuscolumn.lua` files for details.

### Vi-mode

The vi-mode provider by itself only shows an icon. To actually indicate the
current Vim mode, you have to use
`require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color()` for the component's
`hl.fg`.

Note that this is different if you set the `icon` value of the component to
`''`, in that case it'll use the name of the mode instead of an icon.

Here is the simplest method to make a component with proper Vi-mode indication:

```lua
-- Remember to change "components.active[1][1]" according to the rest of your config
components.active[1][1] = {
    provider = 'vi_mode',
    hl = function()
        return {
            name = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name(),
            fg = require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_color(),
            style = 'bold'
        }
    end,
    right_sep = ' ',
    -- Uncomment the next line to disable icons for this component and use the mode name instead
    -- icon = ''
}
```

The Vi-mode provider also provides a helper function `get_mode_highlight_name()`
which can be used through
`require('feline.providers.vi_mode').get_mode_highlight_name()`, it returns the
highlight name for the current mode, which you can then use for the provider's
`hl.name` to give its highlight groups meaningful names.

The Vi-mode provider can take some provider options through the provider `opts`:

- `show_mode_name` (boolean): If true, show the mode name regardless of whether
  the icon is set or not. Useful if you want to see both the indicator icon and
  the mode name.<br> Default: `true` if component's icon is set to `''`, `false`
  otherwise.
- `padding` (boolean): This setting determines if and how the mode name is
  padded. Note that this configuration is only valid when `show_mode_name` is
  `true` or if the component's icon is set to `''`. The value of this option can
  be either set to `false` to disable padding or be one of `'left'`, `'center'`
  or `'right'`.<br> Default: `false`

### Position

The `position` provider can take a `padding` provider option. It can be of one
of the following forms:

```lua
-- Pad line and column numbers, use default amount for padding.
padding = true

-- Use custom padding amount
padding = {
    line = 2,
    col = 2,
}
```

The default padding amount is 3 for line number and 2 for column number.

If you wish, you can also use a custom format for the position provider using
the `format` provider option. All occurrences of `{line}` and `{col}` in the
`format` string will be replaced with the line number and column number,
respectively. For example:

```lua
format = 'Ln {line}, Col {col}'
```

### Scroll bar

The `scroll_bar` provider can take a `reverse` provider option, which may be
either `true` or `false` and will determine if the scroll bar is reversed, which
may be useful if you want the scroll bar to have natural scrolling.

### Search Count

This provider requires `'hlsearch'` (see `:h 'hlsearch'` in Neovim) in order for
it to work.

### File Info

The `file_info` provider has some special provider options that can be passed
through the provider `opts`:

- `colored_icon` (boolean): Determines whether file icon should use color
  inherited from `nvim-web-devicons`.<br> Default: `true`
- `file_modified_icon` (string): The icon that is shown when a file is
  modified.<br> Default:`'●'`
- `file_readonly_icon` (string): The icon that is shown when a file is
  read-only.<br> Default:`'🔒'`
- `path_sep` (string): The separator character in the file path. <br> Default:
  `/` or `\` depending on OS
- `type` (string): Determines which parts of the filename are shown. Its value
  can be one of:

  - `'full-path'`: Full path of the file (eg:
    `'/home/user/.config/nvim/init.lua'`)
  - `'short-path'`: Shortened path of the file (eg: `'/h/u/.c/n/init.lua'`)
  - `'base-only'`: Show only base filename and extension (eg: `'init.lua'`)
  - `'relative'`: File path relative to the current directory.
  - `'relative-short'`: Combination of `'relative'` and `'short-path'`.
  - `'unique'`: Unique substring of the full path.<br> For example: If you have
    three buffers with the paths `'/home/user/file.lua'`,
    `'/home/user/dir1/file.lua'` and `'/home/user/dir2/file.lua'`, Feline will
    show the names `'user/file.lua'`, `'dir1/file.lua'` and `'dir2/file.lua'`
    for them, respectively.<br> If there aren't any files that share the same
    name, it behaves the same as `'base-only'`.
  - `'unique-short'`: Combination of `'unique'` and `'short-path'`.

  <br>Default: `'base-only'`

### File Type

The file type provider has the following options:

- `filetype_icon` (boolean): Whether the file type icon is shown alongside the
  file type. Default: `false`
- `colored_icon` (boolean): Determines whether file icon should use color
  inherited from `nvim-web-devicons`.<br> Default: `true`
- `case` (string): The case of the file type string. Possible values are:
  `'uppercase'`, `'titlecase'` and `'lowercase'`.<br> Default: `'uppercase'`

### Git

The git providers all require
[gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim/), make sure you have
it installed when you use those providers, otherwise they'll have no output.

The git provider also provides a utility function
`require('feline.providers.git').git_info_exists()` for checking if any git
information exists.

### Diagnostics

The diagnostics and LSP providers all require the Neovim built-in LSP to be
configured and at least one LSP client to be attached to the current buffer,
else they'll have no output.

The diagnostics provider also provides a utility function
`require('feline.providers.lsp').diagnostics_exist` for checking if any
diagnostics exists. You can also optionally provide a `severity` function
argument to only check for diagnostics of that severity. The value of `severity`
must be one of the Neovim diagnostic API severities (eg:
`vim.diagnostic.severity.WARN`). For more info on diagnostic severities, do
`:help vim.diagnostic.severity` in Neovim.

## Themes

Feline supports different themes to customize your statusline colors on the fly.
A theme is a Lua table associating color names with their RGB hex codes. Feline
only has one theme built-in, which is the default theme. However, it's possible
to add new themes to Feline. See the [Adding new themes](#adding-new-themes)
section for more info.

There are mainly two ways of using a theme. The first is to set the value of
`theme` in the [setup function](#setup-function) to the theme name or value. The
second way is through the `require('feline').use_theme` function. `use_theme`
can take the theme name as an argument. For example, this is how to use the
default theme:

```lua
require('feline').use_theme('default')
```

`use_theme` can also take the theme table directly as argument, like this:

```lua
-- Theme table
local my_theme = {
    red = '#FF0000',
    green = '#00FF00',
    blue = '#0000FF'
}

require('feline').use_theme(my_theme)
```

### Adding new themes

If you're developing a plugin or colorscheme and wish to support Feline for that
plugin / colorscheme or if you're just a user who wants to be able to quickly
switch your statusline colors, you'd be glad to know that it's possible to add
custom color themes for Feline. You just have to call
`require('feline').add_theme` with the theme name and the colors table. Like
this:

```lua
-- Theme table
local my_theme = {
    red = '#FF0000',
    green = '#00FF00',
    blue = '#0000FF'
}

require('feline').add_theme('my_theme_name', my_theme)
```

The user can then later use that theme through one of the two ways mentioned
above.

### Using theme colors

To use colors from a theme, just use the color name instead of the RGB hex code
in your component's `hl` value, like this:

```lua
hl = {
    bg = 'oceanblue',
    fg = 'white'
}
```

### Default color theme

Feline comes with a default color theme by default, and it falls back to this
theme if a color name is not found in the current theme. Here are the colors
available in the default theme and their values:

| Name        | Value       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `fg`        | `'#D0D0D0'` |
| `bg`        | `'#1F1F23'` |
| `black`     | `'#1B1B1B'` |
| `skyblue`   | `'#50B0F0'` |
| `cyan`      | `'#009090'` |
| `green`     | `'#60A040'` |
| `oceanblue` | `'#0066cc'` |
| `magenta`   | `'#C26BDB'` |
| `orange`    | `'#FF9000'` |
| `red`       | `'#D10000'` |
| `violet`    | `'#9E93E8'` |
| `white`     | `'#FFFFFF'` |
| `yellow`    | `'#E1E120'` |

## Separator presets

Instead of having to remember unicode values for separator glyphs or having to
constantly copy-paste them, you can use Feline's separator presets instead. They
allow you to either use Feline's [default separators](#default-separators) or
your own manually defined separators (added through the
[setup function](#setup-function)) by just using their name. For example:

```lua
right_sep = 'slant_right'
```

Below is a list of all the default separator names and their values:

### Default Separators

| Name                 | Value |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| `vertical_bar`       | `'┃'` |
| `vertical_bar_thin`  | `'│'` |
| `left`               | `''` |
| `right`              | `''` |
| `block`              | `'█'` |
| `left_filled`        | `''` |
| `right_filled`       | `''` |
| `slant_left`         | `''` |
| `slant_left_thin`    | `''` |
| `slant_right`        | `''` |
| `slant_right_thin`   | `''` |
| `slant_left_2`       | `''` |
| `slant_left_2_thin`  | `''` |
| `slant_right_2`      | `''` |
| `slant_right_2_thin` | `''` |
| `left_rounded`       | `''` |
| `left_rounded_thin`  | `''` |
| `right_rounded`      | `''` |
| `right_rounded_thin` | `''` |
| `circle`             | `'●'` |

## Tips and tricks

### Get current window or buffer

When the statusline for a window is being generated, Neovim temporarily sets the
current window and buffer to the window and buffer for which the statusline is
being generated.

This is important to note when you set a component value to a function. Inside a
component value that's set to a function, functions like
`vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()` and `vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()` will
return the statusline window and buffer instead of the actual current window and
buffer number. In order to access the actual current window or buffer, you have
to use `vim.g.actual_curbuf` or `vim.g.actual_curwin` (respectively) inside the
function instead. For example:

```lua
-- Provider function that shows current window number
provider = function()
    return vim.g.actual_curwin
end

-- Provider function that shows name of current buffer
provider = function()
    return vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(tonumber(vim.g.actual_curbuf))
end
```

Note that the values of both `vim.g.actual_curwin` and `vim.g.actual_curbuf` are
strings, not numbers. So if you want to use them as a number, use `tonumber()`
to convert the string to a number first, as shown in the second example.

### Highlight section gaps

By default, gaps between two sections inherit the highlight of the last element
of the section. If you wish to customize the highlight of the gap between two
sections, you can just add a component with only an `hl` value to the end of the
first section.

For example, if you had two sections in the active statusline and wanted the gap
between the first and second section to use a certain background color, you
could do this:

```lua
components.active[1] = {
    {
        -- Insert all components of first section here

        -- Component for customizing highlight for the gap between section 1 and 2
        {
            hl = {
                -- Replace 'oceanblue' with whatever color you want the gap to be.
                bg = 'oceanblue'
            }
        }
    },
    {
        -- Insert all components of second section here
    }
}
```

It's even simpler if you want to use the default `bg` color for the gap between
sections. In that case, you can just put an empty component at the end of the
first section. You don't even have the define the `hl` manually since `hl` by
default uses the default `bg` as its background.
